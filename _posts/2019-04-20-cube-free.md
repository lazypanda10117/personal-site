__Problem Statement__: Let's first define a \(k\)-string to be a string that can only use \(\{0,1,2,\cdots,k-1\}\) as its characters and it is of infinite length. Prove (or disprove) that, 

$$ \forall k: ((k \in \mathbb{Z} \land k \geq 2) \rightarrow (\forall s : (s \in S_k) \rightarrow \lnot T(s))) $$

where \(S_k\) is the set of all \(k\)-string and \(T(s)\) represents the property that \(s\) has a subsequence that repeats itself consecutively for 3 or more times. In other words, we want to see if every \(k\)-string (\(k \geq 2\)) will eventually contain a subsequence that repeat itself 3+ times consecutively. 

__Initial progress__:
I have been stuck on this for a while. First, I want to see what happen for \(k=2\)
Let's construct a 2-string recursively as follow:

$$ S_{i} = S_{i-1}\overline{S_{i-1}} $$

where \(S_{0} = 0\) and \(S_{i-1}\overline{S_{i-1}}\) represents the  concatenation of the two strings and \(\overline{S_{i}}\) represents the complement of \(S_{i}\), where it flips all the bits of \(S_{i}\).
I am currently trying to show that \(S_{\infty}\) is a counter-example to the statement above.

__Solution__:
The sequence suggested above is actually called <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Papers/ubiq15.pdf">Thue-Morse Sequence</a>. One property of this sequence is that it is cubefree, so this effectively solves our problem.
