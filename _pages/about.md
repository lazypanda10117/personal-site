I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo pursuing a double major in Combinatorics & Optimization and Computer Science, with a minor in Pure Mathematics. My interests mainly reside in the intersection of computer science and mathematics, such as graph theory, graph algorithms, discrete optimizations, and computer algebra.

Here is my [CV](pdf/cv/cv.pdf).
