I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo pursuing a double major in Combinatorics & Optimization and Computer Science, with a minor in Pure Mathematics. My interests mainly reside in graph theory, particularly in both structural and algebraic graph theory, along with their applications to other fields, such as coding theory, algorithm design, and quantum computing.

Here is my [CV](assets/pdf/cv/cv.pdf).
