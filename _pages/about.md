I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo majoring in Combinatorics & Optimization and Computer Science, with a minor in Pure Mathematics. My interests mainly reside in the intersection of computer science and mathematics, such as graph theory, graph algorithms, discrete optimizations, and computer algebra.

Here is my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazypanda10117/cv/master/cv.pdf).
