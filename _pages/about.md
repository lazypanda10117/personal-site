#### Brief Introduction:
I am currently a 4th year computer science, combinatorics & optimizations, and pure mathematics student at the University of Waterloo. My interests reside in the intersection of computer science and mathematics, such as graph algorithms and computer algebra.

Academics and internships aside, I enjoy reading, travelling, learning new languages, and playing computer games (Slay the Spire, Train Valley 2, and Mini Metro, to name a few). 

#### Education:
Towards BMath. Honours Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization, and Minor in Pure Mathematics. University of Waterloo.

#### Fun facts
I spend some of my free time making board games. Previously, I have made a card-based RPG board game (see [here](https://github.com/lazypanda10117/Alien-Relocation)) and won the "Best game for a rainy day" award in the Waterloo Game Jam of Fall 2017. I have also built an API for a boardgame <a href="https://github.com/lazypanda10117/koup-api">Coup</a> that allows my friends and I to play the game using only our phones.

#### Resume:
You can find my resume and cv [here](/resume).
