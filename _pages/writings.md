#### Projects

These works are mainly in the form of a survey on topics in graph theory and related areas.

[A graph-theoretic proof for an upper bound of the maximum block code size](/assets/pdf/papers/network_coding_paper.pdf)

- An alternative to the linear-algebraic proof for the upper bound of A_q(n,d) under the restriction d > n(q-1)/q using Turán's theorem.

[On the Connection between Network Coding, Network Flow, and Matroid Theory](/assets/pdf/papers/network_coding_paper.pdf)

- A survey on the link between the study of network coding, network flow, and matroid theory to better understand  the  limits  of  network  coding. It  covers  network  coding  fundamentals,  network  flow  in multicast networks, matroidal network, and some results on the computational complexity and network capacity.

[Deciding Tangles with Weighted Vertex Sets and Certifying Large Branchwidth with Tangle-kits](/assets/pdf/papers/tangle_paper.pdf)

- A report on Elbracht et al.’s partial solution to finding a vertex subset characterization of a tangle, and Oum and Seymour’s paper on certifying large branch-width in polynomial time with tangle-kits.

[Bounding Queue-Number of Planar Graphs](/assets/pdf/papers/queue_number_paper.pdf)

- A written report of a recent proof by Dujmović et al. for a 20-year old conjecture on the queue-number of planar graphs, accompanied by lecture videos.
