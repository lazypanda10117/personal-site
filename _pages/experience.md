[BlackBerry](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) - Security Researcher Intern [Jan'20 - Apr'20]

I am researching about Docker image vulnerabilities scanning using open-source technologies and methods (such as benchmark) to quantitatively measure the effectiveness of an image scanner in an easy way. With this research, we also implemented a new image/packages import framework in Anchore Scanner, leveraging the underlying Anchore Engine, to enhance our existing scanning capabilities. The result of our work, named UBCIS, is now published on USENIX CSET 20'.

In addition to the container research, I have also researched on utilizing machine learning on fuzzing for algorithmic complexity vulnerability, and presented to the Security Research Group on current developments of fuzzing with machine learning and fuzzing for algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities, along with potential problems, experiments, and optimizations.

[Zenefits](https://www.zenefits.com/) - Software Engineering Intern [May'19 - Aug'19]

I worked on building new features for the Performance Management platform with React and integrating with the backend through GraphQL services. Also, I have designed multiple new services to support general data editing functionality within our Talent team's app flow, where some of them require integrations with the existing distributed queue system, Celery.
