[BlackBerry](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) - Security Researcher Intern [Jan'20 - Apr'20]

I am researching about Docker image vulnerabilities scanning using open-source technologies and methods (such as benchmark) to quantitatively measure the effectiveness of an image scanner in an easy way. With this research, we also implemented a new image/packages import framework in Anchore Scanner, leveraging the underlying Anchore Engine, to enhance our existing scanning capabilities.


In addition to the container research, I have also researched on utilizing machine learning on fuzzing for algorithmic complexity vulnerability, and presented to the Security Research Group on current developments of fuzzing with machine learning and fuzzing for algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities, along with potential problems, experiments, and optimizations.
